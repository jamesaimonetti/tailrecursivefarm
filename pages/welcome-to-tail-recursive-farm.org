* Welcome to Tail Recursive Farm

We're just getting started so nothing to show just yet. But! Some goals include converting the ~3 acres of pasture to silvopasture, putting ruminants (likely sheep) and fowl (likely chickens) into the silvopasture system, and growing enough food for our family of 4 + our local community.

We'll begin in earnest in July with observing the farm and beginning to plan.

We hope to blog about progress and setbacks, as well as develop resource pages for the different parts of the farm as they're developed.

Thanks for stopping by!
